Portfolio Flutter Web App

This is a minimal Flutter web portfolio template inspired by https://vishnupriyan-ss.firebaseapp.com/.

Files generated:
- `pubspec.yaml` - dependencies and metadata
- `web/index.html` - basic entry
- `lib/main.dart` - main app UI

How to run (Windows / PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "d:\MyWorks\Vibs AI Research\portfolio_flutter"
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

Notes:
- Replace the placeholder text and image URL in `lib/main.dart` with your own content.
- This project requires Flutter SDK installed and configured for web (stable channel). See https://flutter.dev for setup instructions.
